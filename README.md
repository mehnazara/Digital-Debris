CSE360 - Computer Interfacing
We have incorporated Inductive Proximity, Ultrasonic and Infrared Sensors in the project in order to differentiate between metal and non-metal trash. Ultrasonic sensor was used to calculate the
corresponding filled volume of the trash can in order to show how much of it, has been filled up. As for the remaining I/O devices, 2 Servo motors and 1 16x2 LCD Display were used.
